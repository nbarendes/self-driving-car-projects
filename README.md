In this repository I will share the source code of all the projects of Udacity Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree.


#### [P1 - Detecting Lane Lines (basic)](CarND-LaneLines-P1)
 - **Summary:** Detected highway lane lines on a video stream. Used OpencV image analysis techniques to identify lines, including Hough Transforms and Canny edge detection.
 - **Keywords:** Computer Vision

#### [P2 - Advanced Lane Finding](CarND-Advanced-Lane-Lines-P2)
 - **Summary:** Built an advanced lane-finding algorithm using distortion correction, image rectification, color transforms, and gradient thresholding. Identified lane curvature and vehicle displacement. Overcame environmental challenges such as shadows and pavement changes.
 - **Keywords:** Computer Vision, OpenCV
 
 #### [P3 - Traffic Sign Classification](CarND-Traffic-Sign-Classifier-P3)
 - **Summary:** Built and trained a deep neural network to classify traffic signs, using TensorFlow. Experimented with different network architectures. Performed image pre-processing and validation to guard against overfitting.
 - **Keywords:** Deep Learning, TensorFlow, Computer Vision

#### [P4 - Behavioral Cloning](CarND-Behavioral-Cloning-P4)
 - **Summary:** Built and trained a convolutional neural network for end-to-end driving in a simulator, using TensorFlow and Keras. Used optimization techniques such as regularization and dropout to generalize the network for driving on multiple tracks.
 - **Keywords:** Deep Learning, Keras, Convolutional Neural Networks

 #### [P5 - Extended Kalman Filter](CarND-Extended-Kalman-Filter-P5)
 - **Summary:** Implement the extended Kalman filter in C++. Simulated lidar and radar measurements are used to detect a bicycle that travels around your vehicle. Kalman filter, lidar measurements and radar measurements are used to track the bicycle's position and velocity.
 - **Keywords:** C++, Kalman Filter
